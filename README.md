# Intervals Notification

## Purpose

This is based on the HIIT principles of intervals:
   1. Configurable warm up (maintain 70 bpm)
   2. Max HR for time or distance
   3. Rest for time, distance, or HR
        1. Example rest based on HR: be at 130 bpm for 20 seconds
        2. Watch would provide audible beep and vibrate
   4. Configurable repetition of max and rest HR and/or time values
